This project is a simple and inexpensive method of relaying the Red and Green scoring lights from a [Favero Full-Arm-05](https://www.favero.com/en2_fencing_sport_electronic_scoreboard_fencing_signalling_equipment_apparatus_for_foil_sword_epee_sabre-29-17.html) scoring machine to LED lights attached to the interior sides of a fencing mask.

The output data from the Favero using an [RJ11](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251832602517821.html) Connector to an [Arduino ESP8266 WeMos D1 Mini](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805831695231.html) using the wiring [Favero Serial Parser schematic](Schematic_Favero-Light-Relays.pdf) with the exception that the LED Relay Control was left off for this build. The Arduino code [8266 Parser and Transmitter Favero](8266_Parser_and_Transmitter_Favero) was then uploaded the Wemos.

The [circuit for the LED Lights Receiver](Schematic_Mask_Lights_PCB.pdf) was then designed and the [PCB](PCB_Top.PNG) ordered. Some of the parts used where an [OLED SSD1306](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805784586367.html), a [MH-CD42 Charging Module](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2255799917197675.html), [stout 15mm tall push buttons](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251832725948381.html)
