This project is a simple and inexpensive method of relaying the Red and Green scoring lights from a [Favero Full-Arm-05](https://www.favero.com/en2_fencing_sport_electronic_scoreboard_fencing_signalling_equipment_apparatus_for_foil_sword_epee_sabre-29-17.html) scoring machine to LED lights attached to the interior sides of a fencing mask.

The output data from the Favero using an [RJ11](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251832602517821.html) Connector to an [Arduino ESP8266 WeMos D1 Mini](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805831695231.html) using the wiring [Favero Serial Parser schematic](Schematic_Favero-Light-Relays.pdf) with the exception that the LED Relay Control was left off for this build. The Arduino code [8266 Parser and Transmitter Favero](8266_Parser_and_Transmitter_Favero) was then uploaded the Wemos.

The [circuit for the LED Lights Receiver](Schematic_Mask_Lights_PCB.pdf) was then designed and the [PCB](PCB_Top.PNG) ordered. Some of the parts used where an [OLED SSD1306](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805784586367.html), a [MH-CD42 Charging Module](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2255799917197675.html), [stout 15mm tall push buttons](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251832725948381.html), [3mm LEDs](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805857472652.html), a [power switch](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256803752541650.html), a [LiPo 3.7V battery](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256806371239803.html) and [an 8 by 8 LED Matrix](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256801079332896.html). A couple of notes on the PCB design, it is functional but by no means optimized and there are a couple of errors. Specifically the Green_Red_Button connects to D0/GPIO16 which is internally pulled down so the button, which is connected to GND, should instead be connected to 3.3V and therefore the button will not function. The Arduino code is adapted to not use the left Green_Red_Button. Also, the Battery connection markings are reversed and the + and - are marked backwards from what they actually are on the circuit. If you connect the battery as indicated, as one would reasonably do, the PCB will start to heat up and smoke.
